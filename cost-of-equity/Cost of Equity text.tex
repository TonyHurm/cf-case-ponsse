Cost of equity

The rate for the cost of equity used in our calculations is 6.37~\%. This rate has been calculated by using the capital asset pricing model adjusted with an added liquidity premium. The liquidity premium used in our calculations is 3.2~\%. We calculated several possible values for \beta, which is apparent from the appendix. The beta we have desided to use is the estimated five year \beta for ponsse in comparison to the OMXHCAPPI index. The value of the \beta is 0.55. The market risk we have estimated to be 5.8~\%. From these values we arrive at the following formula:

\bar{r}_{ponsse} = r_{f} + \hat{\beta} _{ponsse}(\bar{r}_{market} - r_{f}) + r_{l}

Where,
\bar{r}_{ponsse} = the mean risk of Ponsse Oyj for the next five years,
r_{f} = the risk free rate,
\hat{\beta}_{ponsse} = the estimated five year \beta of Ponsse Oyj,
\bar{r}_{market} = the mean market risk,
r_{l} = the liqvidity premium.
