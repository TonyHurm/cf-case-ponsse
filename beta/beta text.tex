Market \beta

The market \beta we have used in our calculations is the five year estimated \beta of Ponsse~Oyj. The value of this \beta is 0.55. In our calculations we have agreed to use a five year investment horizon resulting in the use of the five year \beta. Other estimated \beta calculations are available from the appendix. In the calculations we have used the OMXHCAPPI as the market index. The formula for our \beta calculations is as follows:

\beta (asset) = \frac{cov(index,asset)}{\sigma ^{2}_{asset}}

Where,
\beta (asset) = The market \beta of Ponsse~Oyj,
cov(index,asset) = The Covariance between Ponsse~Oyj and the market index OMXHCAPPI,
\sigma ^{2}_{asset} = The variance of Ponsse~Oyj.
